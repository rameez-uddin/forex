this includes:
stop loss hunting.
liquidty sweep
traps


trapping the retailer is so easy.

stop loss hunting and liquidity sweep are very attached to sessions highs and lows

LIQUIDITY SWEEP:

(bullish)
in this concept, the banks and big instiutions breaks the last swing low with a big wick candle and then continues it bullish trend, sweeping out the retailer liquidity...
WE SHOULD CONSIDER BUYING IN THIS SITUATION.

(bearish)
in this concept, the banks and the big instiutions break the last swing high with a small bullish movement. and then continues its bearish trend, sweeping out the retailer liquidity...
WE SHOULD CONSIDER SELLING IN THIS SITUATION.

(sideways)
after a long bullish movement, the markets keeps moving in a same range and keeps going out of the range from both sides. but it stays at the middle of the range always.
WE SHOULD CONSIDER OUR RISK MANAGEMENT IN THIS SITUTATUIN BECAUSE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE MARKET IN THIS SITUATION.
